		<h3>Following Projects</h3>
		
		<p>To encourage communication and knowledge transfer about projects on SimTK, members can follow any number of projects. By following a project, you will receive updates and news relevant to the project. There are two types of project followers, public or private:</p>
		
		
		<ul>
		<li><p><b>Public follower:</b> Others will see your name and profile in the list of project followers. By becoming a public follower, other members of SimTK may message you regarding your interest and involvement in the project.</p></li>
		<li><p><b>Private follower:</b> Your name and profile will NOT be displayed in the list of followers. The number of private followers is displayed at the top of the follower list.</p></li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>To see the list of public followers on a project, click on the number next to the “Follow: SimTK” label.</p>

		<br />
		<h4>How to Follow</h4>
		
		<p>In order to follow a project, you must be a <a href="/account/register.php">member</a> of SimTK. Use the drop-down menu next to the “Follow: SimTK” label in the top right of every project page to follow the project as a public or private follower or to unfollow the project.</p>
